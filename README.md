# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview

The MechaCar, the newest prototype from AutosRUs, is experiencing production troubles that are hindering the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. This analysis will use Rscripts to review the production data to help the manufacturing team overcome these obstacles.

## Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Linear regression was performed, with all available variables in the data set: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD, and mpg. The linear regression and summary are shown below. 
- Based on their p-values, vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, given the small p-value of 5.35e-11, which is much less than the significance level of 0.05. This gives us enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope is not zero.
- The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes roughly 71% effectively based on the R-squared value of 0.7149. There may also be other factors that contribute to mpg variability that were not included in the dataset.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Analysis for the total and each individual lot are shown below. 
- Analysis of the data for three lots as a whole shows that the coils are within the required ranges, with a variance of 76.23.
- Analysis of individual lots show that Lots 1 and 2 are well below the 100 PSI variance (1.15 and 10.13), which do meet the design specifications.
- However, Lot 3 is showing a much higher variance of 220.01, which does not meet the design specifications.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
